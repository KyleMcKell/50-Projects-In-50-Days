# Blurry Loader

Blurs an image and shows a % based on how blurred the image is to appear as if the image is loading based on the % shown

## What I learned

- Blur filter
- Repositioning backgrounds to eliminate the whitespace caused by blur
- setInterval and clearInterval
-

## Notes

- Had to follow along the tutorial a bit to understand how to give myself a interval. At first I tried to use things like setTimeout or sleep, but those didn't really work all too well. Once I found out the setInterval and clearInterval, things made much more sense
- You could add in an algorithm to make it so the blur, opacity, and loading happen at a different pace as to make it seem like it's loading faster at the end, or something of the like, but I don't deem that necessary for this tutorial, I think it's more understanding the usage of setInterval and clearInterval
- I learned a lot with this one, but I don't really think most of it is made by me. Since I had to follow the tutorial for the hard part (set and clear interval), it sort of gave away the fun parts of this one to figure out. But at least now if I run into this problem again, I'll be able to implement it easily!
