# Rotating Navbar

Navbar which when clicked, rotates the content of the page and reveals the nav elements

## What I learned

- How to rotate elements and animate them
- How to target the next child with "+" in CSS
- How to position a button, and change it to a different button when clicked

## Notes

- Some parts of this project were wacky. Some of my solutions, while not elegant, seem to work very well.
- I need to do better at basic HTML and CSS page formatting.
