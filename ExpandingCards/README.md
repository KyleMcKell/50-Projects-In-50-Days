# Expanding Cards

Simple project consisting of cards, and animating them using CSS and flexbox

## What I learned

- CSS Animations
- Background properties and values
- Reinforced positions in CSS
- How to make text non-selectable and hide the caret

## Notes

- I have been pushing off html and css lately so I have gotten a bit rusty at them. I decided to start these projects to refamiliarize myself with them, and this project was successful in doing so for me. Overall I am very happy with what I have made.

- Something that I would improve would have to be that when you open up some images, if the image has to stretch, it does so after transitioning into a larger image. This isn't ideal, but it works for now. I would like to have the images always be the correct sizing before the content exapands from being active.
