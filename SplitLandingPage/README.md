# Split Landing Page

Split Landing Page with 2 items, when hovered, the respective item takes up more of the page with an animation

## What I learned

- How to use background images and a div for an overlay for them
- More about Z-index
- Classes vs ID and the behaviors that happen through that

## Notes

- This project was weird. The last one (blurry loading) sort of threw me on the wrong course at first. I started by trying to make the background images divs, and then adding an image to those, but that proved to be extremely difficult to do with flexbox and the resizing capabilities. It became very easy to do this once I decided to just make them a background image for their respective containers, since that's what was needed anyways
- The overlay was the hardest part about this. I still don't quite understand why the z indexes I used work, but they do. It's weird, if I don't specify a z index for their container, the overlay doesn't show, however, if I do, then the overlay shows and everything works great. This z index can literally be anything, as high or as low as you want.
- This project was boring because I found out how to do it with literally no JS
