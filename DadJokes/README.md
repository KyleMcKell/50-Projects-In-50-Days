# Dad Jokes

Fetches an API of dad jokes to display a random joke on the screen whenever a button is pressed

## What I learned

- Fetch API
- Async, Await, Promises
- Returning a value of promise from an async function
- Styling buttons better

## Notes

- This project was the first one featuring the fetch api, promises, and the like. All of this was pretty fun to learn and actually finally apply from just watching videos on them
- I am still confused how to return values from async await functions. Whenever I tried I would always get an error that I was returning of type Promise<T> which isn't helpful if I'm trying to assign the return value to a string. I avoided this by updating the value in the function itself, but I'm a strong believer in pure functions, so this hurts a bit. I'm sure there's a way to do it, I'll have to research more.
