# Sound Board

Sound Board where if something is clicked, a sound is played, if a button is clicked again it stops the sound and replays it

## What I learned

- Audio tags
- Array.prototype.method.call to use array methods on nodelists

## Notes

- I've done something similar to this in the past, so it was a breeze to make. I decided to use a different solution than a for loop and using the index to of the two lists during a for loop with using the Array.prototype.indexOf.call() method
