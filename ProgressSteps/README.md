# Progress Steps

A small project of creating a progress bar that you would see in a form fill out

## What I learned

- Utilizing Z index in a real project
- Absolute and relative positioning
- Flex containers, specifically space-evenly

## Notes

- The hardest part about this one was definitely having the progress bar actually work. I was confused how to make it go behind the circles, and also generally how to position it and the like. It took some looking up, and some tutorial following, but I eventually figured it out.

- This could be improved with a forEach method in the script. This is what is done in the Udemy course. However, I am going to keep my code that I personally wrote as to show my progress as a developer, and add in a way to use a forEach method instead as a comment.
