# Event KeyCodes

A directory of small projects from Brad Traversy and Florin Pop's Udemy course

## What I learned

- Using event.(key, keycode, and code)

## Notes

- Today I didn't have all too much time to code, so I decided to keep this one simple. The app was real easy to make, but still a good exercise for practice.
- The styling for this specific project was less of a priority than the logic
