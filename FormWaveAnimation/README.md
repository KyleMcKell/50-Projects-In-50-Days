# Form Wave Animation

Login form with an animation that "waves" the text of the form up when a respective form line is clicked

## What I learned

- Editing HTML with JavaScript (adding the spans between each letter)
- Display properties that aren't flexbox
- Using "+" in CSS to have an effect happen on a selected attribute when a different attribute has something happen to it (hover, focus, etc.)
- Styling Forms

## Notes

- This one really challenged me, I tried to do it using flexbox for a reasonable while, but I just couldn't really seem to do it.
- Thinking back, I think I accidentally set it to "display: flexbox" instead of "display:flex" if this was the case that's a bit embarassing and I'll have to watch for that bug in the future.
- My basic styling skills are definitely in need of some patching up. I think a large majority of this is my lack of understanding with different display properties, if I get more comfortable using inline-block, block, and whatnot, I think this will get better.
- I also need to understand positioning better in blocks. Relative, absolute, etc. are all things that I feel like I need to understand more, and all need practice.
- I had to follow the tutorial pretty much all the way through for this one. However, I did learn a lot. I'm going to review this one over the next couple of days to try to understand what was taught here more.
